        <p class="text">A human fatigue detection system is a project that aims to develop a technology that can detect and monitor the level of fatigue in humans.This system can use various methods such as analyzing physiological signals, tracking eye movements, or monitoring changes in behavior to determine the level of fatigue in a person. The goal of this project is to improve safety in various industries, such as transportation or healthcare, by alerting individuals or supervisors when a person is too fatigued to perform their duties effectively and safely. The system can also be used to collect data on fatigue patterns and help develop strategies to prevent fatigue-related incidents in the future.</p>
