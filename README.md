# human-fatigue-system
This project is designed to detect when a person is tired or drowsy, especially while doing tasks like driving or working for long hours. The system uses a camera or sensors to monitor signs of fatigue, such as eye blinking, yawning, or head movements. When it detects fatigue, it gives a warning to help the person stay alert and safe.
